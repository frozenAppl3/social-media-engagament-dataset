## Dataset Overview

The dataset consists of **189 participants**, each assigned to one of two experimental conditions: **Control** or **Gamified**. The dataset includes various engagement-related attributes to analyze factors affecting user experience and app reuse intent.

## Features

- **Participant ID**: Unique identifier for each participant.
- **Age**: Participant's age ranging from 18 to 65 years.
- **Gender**: Categorical variable (`Male`, `Female`, `Other`).
- **Readiness to Change**: Psychological readiness to adopt behavioral change, measured on a scale of 1-10.
- **Condition**: Experimental group assignment (`Control` or `Gamified`).
- **Enjoyment**: Self-reported enjoyment of the experience (Scale: 1-10).
- **Engagement**: Level of engagement with the experience (Scale: 1-10).
- **Reuse Intent**: Willingness to reuse the application (Scale: 1-10).

## Data Collection Process

- **Demographics**: Age and gender data were recorded based on participant responses.
- **Readiness to Change**: Measured using a validated psychological scale.
- **Condition Assignment**: Participants were assigned to either the `Control` or `Gamified` group as part of the study design.
- **Engagement Metrics**:
  - The `Gamified` condition included challenge-based elements to enhance engagement.
  - Enjoyment and engagement levels were assessed based on participant feedback.
  - Higher engagement was observed to be positively correlated with `reuse_intent`.

## Usage

This dataset can be used for:
- A/B testing analysis for behavioral interventions
- Statistical and machine learning experiments
- Engagement modeling in digital applications
